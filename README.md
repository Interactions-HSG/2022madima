# 2022madima Supplemental Repository
#### "Automatic Classification of High vs. Low Individual Nutrition Literacy Levels from Loyalty Card Data in Switzerland"


This repository contains the code for our analysis, the code to generate the graphs used in our work, and supplemental materials (survey screenshots and one additional table).

- The code (in the subfolder "code") is separated into three jupyter notebooks separated by topic: Survey data analysis, food purchase data analysis, and machine learning model training.

- The data (in the subfolder "data") contains the survey data in an anonymized form and the receipts data including all items that could be matched to entries in the EatFit database.

- The survey (in the subfolder "survey_screenshots") illustrates the different question design for the three different participant groups. However, it is important to remember that the questions in the third part about food plates are a random subset of 8 questions out of a catalogue of 70. These screenshots are therefore not able to capture every single possible question posed to participants. Moreover, the screenshots show the English variant of the survey, whereas most participants completed the survey in German since the target-demographic was German speaking.
